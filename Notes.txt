1) Pre-receive (server side hook):
- Sounds like the best option so far. However, it is reserved fot GitHub enterprise only and haven't been able to test it.
- It CANNOT be bypassed using git options from client.

This is a github repo with platform samples for using pre-receive hook on GitHub.
This directory contains examples for pre-receive hooks which are a GitHub Enterprise feature
to block unwanted commits before they even reach your repository.
Link: https://github.com/github/platform-samples/tree/master/pre-receive-hooks

Not able to test, don't know what we see on EasyJet.

2) Pre-push (client hook)
- We could use pre-push to check if commit messages are up to requirements.
- Unfortunately if the user hasn't setup locally to point to the right directory folder we could still push changes without passing the check
- also available to skip manually using --no-verify tag

3) GitHub Action
- create a GitHub action that will check the messages in the PR and fail if it doesn't meet our requirements.
