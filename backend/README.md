Solution structure that adheres to the Domain Driven Design principles:
a) Application
b) Common
c) Domain
d) Infrastructure
e) Persistence
f) Presentation --> this will not be included as the React application (web-app) is our front-end instead of razor pages
g) Specification


Previous folder structure that I have followed before:
